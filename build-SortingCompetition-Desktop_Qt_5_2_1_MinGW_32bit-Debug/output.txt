PREFACE 7
Of 2
all 3
the 3
sovereigns 10
that 4
have 4
worn 4
the 3
crown 5
of 2
England, 8
Queen 5
Elizabeth 9
is 2
the 3
most 4
puzzling, 9
the 3
most 4
fascinating, 12
the 3
most 4
blindly 7
praised, 8
and 3
the 3
most 4
unjustly 8
blamed. 7
To 2
make 4
lists 5
of 2
her 3
faults 6
and 3
virtues 7
is 2
easy. 5
One 3
may 3
say 3
with 4
little 6
fear 4
of 2
contradiction 13
that 4
her 3
intellect 9
was 3
magnificent 11
and 3
her 3
vanity 6
almost 6
incredibly 10
childish; 9
that 4
she 3
was 3
at 2
one 3
time 4
the 3
most 4
outspoken 9
of 2
women, 6
at 2
another 7
the 3
most 4
untruthful; 11
that 4
on 2
one 3
occasion 8
she 3
would 5
manifest 8
a 1
dignity 7
that 4
was 3
truly 5
sovereign, 10
while 5
on 2
another 7
the 3
rudeness 8
of 2
her 3
manners 7
was 3
unworthy 8
of 2
even 4
the 3
age 3
in 2
which 5
she 3
lived. 6
Sometimes 9
she 3
was 3
the 3
strongest 9
of 2
the 3
strong, 7
sometimes 9
the 3
weakest 7
of 2
the 3
weak. 5
At 2
a 1
distance 8
of 2
three 5
hundred 7
years 5
it 2
is 2
not 3
easy 4
to 2
balance 7
these 5
claims 6
to 2
censure 7
and 3
to 2
admiration, 11
but 3
at 2
least 5
no 2
one 3
should 6
forget 6
that 4
the 3
little 6
white 5
hand 4
of 2
which 5
she 3
was 3
so 2
vain 4
guided 6
the 3
ship 4
of 2
state 5
with 4
most 4
consummate 10
skill 5
in 2
its 3
perilous 8
passage 7
through 7
the 3
troubled 8
waters 6
of 2
the 3
latter 6
half 4
of 2
the 3
sixteenth 9
century. 8
